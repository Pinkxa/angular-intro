# Angular intro

Angular JS is a Javascript framework for creating client side applications.

## Intro

There is a good introduction video on the Angular JS web site, but it is for an older verson Angular. To try is out I created this repository that already contains all the dependencies.
Open `index.html` in a browser there should be no errors if you open `Google Developer Tools`, `Firebug` or `Firefox Developer Tools` (I recommend installing the Firebug add-on when using Firefox).
